Sometimes... <br/>
I think I can write,<br/>
I think I should sing.<br/>
I feel like dancing,<br/>
but I am not sure 'coz I never tried.<br/>

I can joke, write a comedy<br/>
make you laugh, who need a remedy?<br/>
got a good sense of humor,<br/>
But I am not sure, I never tried.<br/>

People say I look cute,<br/>
I have a heart, beautiful,<br/>
Someone can love me too,<br/>
But I am so afraid of a no.<br/>

A wizard, yes I am a wizard,<br/>
They see the magic in me, I heard<br/>
I never saw such a thing in me ever,<br/>
What? Have I tried? Naah, Never!!<br/>

Wonder if I had ever tried,<br/>
even a single thing in my life,<br/>
I could be a singer, a dancer very fine,<br/>
or a magician, turning a tiger into a swine.<br/>

Well, It is never too late to start my friend,<br/>
if the start is good, you will reach a fabulous end.<br/>
I will become everything in my life, all I want,<br/>
You wait and watch, as I triumph<br/>

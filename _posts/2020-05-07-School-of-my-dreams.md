Dreams, I see very rarely,<br />
But I remember them very fairly.<br />
One night I saw a lovely dream,<br />
A school of chocolate & cream.<br />
<br/>
It was big, huge and tall,<br />
It seemed as if it was going to fall.<br />
But it stood hard for very long,<br />
And I could hear a sweet song.<br />
<br/>
On entering it, I saw,<br />
Playing children, without the teacher's claw.<br />
Singing, playing, running and gossipping,<br />
And I could see a place even for shopping.<br />
<br/>
Shop shop shop & shop,<br />
Even music, rock, or pop.<br />
I came to know the song,<br />
It was of a boy singing for very long.<br />
<br/>
No, he was not of the flesh,<br />
But of choco very fresh.<br />
Every tree, and cloud flying,<br />
Everywhere was cream lying.<br />
<br/>
It seemed more like a Chocolate than a school,<br />
Believe me, I saw, I am not making you fool.<br />
Every child ran and play,<br />
no race, without any fray.<br />
<br/>
That's the joy of life I seek,<br />
My whole life not days or weeks.<br />
That's the freedom, I seek,<br />
I want to spend time laughing up to cheeks.<br />

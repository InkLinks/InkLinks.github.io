“I have a story to tell,<br/> 
I was standing next to a deep well,<br/>
Believe me! It was so deep,<br/>
perhaps it went down to hell<br/>

I was too afraid to peep in,<br/>
Alas! I inadvertently gave it my shining coin,<br/>
I looked and looked as far as I could,<br/>
but “how did I end up in this scary dark wood?”<br/>

Please daddy come and help me here, <br/>
You must be watching me, hiding somewhere,<br/>
for you never leave me alone like this,<br/>
please come out I am very scared<br/>

And flying came a man in a radiant red cape,<br/>
jumped into the well like an agile ape<br/>
He said,” Your dad sent me, I am here to help”<br/>
giving back my shining precious, covered in kelp<br/>


I got back my shining coin, yeyy!!<br/> 
you are a hero dad, you saved the day.”<br/>
said my child, after waking up in morning today<br/>
I replied,” Haha! Thanks my darling. “<br/>

As she left to make a fort out of clay<br/>
I really felt like a hero on that fine day,<br/>
yeah I know I did not do anything at all,<br/>
but you know what?, actually she made my day.<br/>

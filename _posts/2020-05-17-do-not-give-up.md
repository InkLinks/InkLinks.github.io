<p align="center">
Hang in there you,<br />
It is not a time to give up yet,<br />
We are so close to success,<br />
OH! plaese do not be upset.<br />
<br />
for every path to victory,<br />
is strewed with hurdles,<br />
so hold you weakening emotions,<br />
and make your grit curdle.<br />
<br />
I know this is a tough situation,<br />
we are going through a trying time.<br />
but after every dark wintery night,<br />
comes a warm morning with a bright shine.<br />

When I asked a child begging for food,<br />
wrapped in morose clothes, there she stood.<br />
"Why do you beg? Don't you go to any school?"<br />
She cried before me,<br />

"Ah! was a fine day with a peaceful morning,<br />
And we were ready, waiting for my granny to pass.<br />
We knew it had was her time,<br />
as we were not left with even a single dime.<br />
to feed her or to fill our bellies for that matter.<br />
We were the poorest in all of the world.<br />

Well, It has to be her as<br />
she is the oldest & weakest<br />
said my father with severe coughing.<br />
and then I saw him slowly fainting.<br />
He died crying out of hunger.<br />
I did not believe so, I was puzzled.<br />

How could hunger be our enemy?<br />
It had been with us since forever.<br />
I saw my father defeating it almost daily.<br />
He used to give me his share of food and sleep hungry.<br />
It never killed him before, then why did it today?<br />
I lost the strongest, so-dear father of mine.<br />

We cried and shouted as loud as we could.<br />
But no one listened to our lamentings.<br />
as my father died due to hunger<br />
because DEATH laughed even louder."<br />

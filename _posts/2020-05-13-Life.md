My Dear friend,<br/>
Every morning does not,<br />
start with a rainbow,<br />
or a perfect weather,<br />
<br />
Some are dark and cloudy,<br />
& some are pale and gloomy.<br />
While some are happy and merry.<br />
<br />
Nothing is permanent here.<br />
And this is what makes LIFE<br />
worth living atogether<br/>

  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“I have a story to tell, 
I was standing next to a deep well,
Believe me! I was so deep,
perhaps it went down to hell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was too afraid to peep in,
Alas! I advertently gave it my shining coin,
I looked and looked as far as I could,
but “how did I end up in this scary dark wood?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please daddy come and help me here, 
You must be watching me, hiding somewhere,
for you never leave me alone like this,
please come out I am very scared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And flying came a man in a radiant red cape,
jumped into the well like an agile ape
He said,” Your dad sent me, I am here to help”
giving back my shining precious, covered in kelp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got back my shining coin, yeyy!! 
you are a hero dad, you saved the day.”
said my child, after waking up in morning today
I replied,” Haha! Thanks my darling. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she left to make a fort out of clay
I really felt like a hero on that fine day,
yeah I know I did not do anything at all,
but you know what?, actually she made my day.&lt;/p&gt;
